 *Goal: To give union command to unite paths like union(1, 2);
 *To return a boolean to check wheather two points are connected
 *If the two points are connected then return true or false
 *We use arrays to do this
 *There is an Quick Implementation of this involving a N^2 approach to the problem.
 *Quadratic Algorithms do not scale with Technology

//We assume that "is connected to" is an equivalent relation implying:
// Reflexive : p is connected to p
// Symmetric : if p is connected to q, then q is connected to p
// Transitive : if p is connected to r, and r is connected to q, then q is connected to p.
