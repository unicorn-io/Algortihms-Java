<h1>Dynamic Connectivity</h1>

<h3>Goal: To give union command to unite paths like union(1, 2);
To return a boolean to check wheather two points are connected
If the two points are connected then return true or false
We use arrays to do this
There is an Quick Implementation of this involving a N^2 approach to the problem.
Quadratic Algorithms do not scale with Technology</h3>



<h4>We assume that "is connected to" is an equivalent relation implying:</h4>
<ol>
 <li>Reflexive : p is connected to p</li>
 <li>Symmetric : if p is connected to q, then q is connected to p</li>
 <li>Transitive : if p is connected to r, and r is connected to q, then q is connected to p.</li>
</ol>
